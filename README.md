# Human behaviour-based automatic depression analysis using hand-crafted statistics and deep learned spectral features

This is the spectral data transformation code used for two papers:

[1] Human behaviour-based automatic depression analysis using hand-crafted statistics and deep learned spectral features (oral presentation of FG 2018, link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8373825/)

[2] Spectral Representation of Behaviour Primitives for Depression Analysis (IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8976305)


# Get started

You only need to use MATLAB to open the following files

demo_extract_feature_select.m:  demo for extracting spectral map and features using the first frequency alignment method (select) in [2]

demo_extract_feature_resample.m:   demo for extracting spectral map and features using the second frequency alignment method (resample) in [2]


# Comments

The code is the data transformation part of the above papers.

It convert long multi-channel time-sereis data to two small spectrum heatmaps without any distoration. The amplitude spectrum map contains amplitude information while phase spectrum map contains termporal dynamics information.

It also convert data of variable lengths to heatmaps of fixed size.

We haven't show the CNN training scripts because CNN strcutures always depend on the task and users may use different platforms.
